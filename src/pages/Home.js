                The goal is to predict the nodal coordinates of these structures under dynamic conditions, 
                leveraging the principles of physics, described by a 2nd-order ODE with ill-conditioned matrices, to inform the NN's learning process. 
                Our experiments demosntrate the optimally tuned PINN model is capable of achieving
                the same accuracy as the traditional numerical methods, FEM. The generous supervision was given from Dr. Jing Qin at University of Kentucky.

              detail = {`
              Time of death (TOD) is a crucial factor in forensic science, particularly in circadian gene analysis, 
              but it is often missing from post-mortem sample records unlike circadian gene expression data. 
              Our aim is to predict the expected TOD and its uncertainty range from post-mortem samples using probabilistic models.
              We conducted experiments with tuned six models and found that the Gaussian Energy-Based Model (GEBM) outperformed others in terms of probabilistic metrics: NLL, CRPS, and ECE.
              This research is supported by WPI, NSF, and UMass Chan Medical School.

              detail = {`
              A game of tic-tac-toe played by throwing a ball would be inherently random, unless the player has perfect control.
              Leading a group of four, I developed a stochastic tic-tac-toe game environment, MinMax Tree verifier, symmetric-aware Q-learning algorithm, 
              and lower bound estimation with binomial coefficients for the required number of episodes to make an effective agent.
              Our agent effectively learned the optimal strategy when stochasticity was introduced, which is, avoiding the center and preferring the corner at the beginning.
              The future work is DQN for n*n boards and extension to POMDP.

              detail={`
              This project involves Exploratory Data Analysis and developing a machine learning model to predict early attrition among job applicants. 
              First, we performed EDA on the dataset to understand the features, leading to feature creation that increases ROC_AUC by at least 0.03 (which is significant!).
              The features permitted are data available only before hiring, excluding job satisfaction, work environment, etc.
              My project assesses the likelihood of an applicant leaving the company within the first few years of employment. 
              Raw data is limited and imbalanced, so using synthetic data augmentation library doubled the F1 score from 0.4 to 0.8.

              One of te model tested during the REU at WPI was CGAN, and the model underperformed due to data limitation.
              To confirm the model's capability with sufficient data, I implemented both regression and classification CGANs. 
              This project is an extension of it.
              This CGAN takes an integer as input and generates a digit image of the integer. 
              Because of noize at the input, the model is capable of generating a different digit image almost every time (and no mode collapse).
              The challenge was tuning the hyperparameters to achieve effective learning, and finally I achieved at least 60-80% of images for each digit identifiable by human eyes.

              In my Saturday Japanese school, some students are excelling in math and interested in advanced mathematics topics.
              I was giving them improvised problems occasionally, but I decided to create a set of worksheets for them.
              As there are plenty of resources for typical curriculum, so I selected topics that are not covered in the program.
              The worksheets cover topics start from arithmetics like exponentiation and remainder.
              gradually guiding to number theory, graph theory, and computer science without necessity of proof (focusing on learning fun facts).
              The most advanced topics include 15 Puzzle and Kadane's Algorithm.
